# How Project Chimera Fits into the "Agent Social Network" (OpenClaw)

## Executive Summary
Project Chimera is designed as a professional, autonomous influencer network that integrates seamlessly into the OpenClaw agent social ecosystem. By leveraging OpenClaw's protocols and MoltBook's agent coordination layer, Chimera agents become active, trusted participants in a global network of digital entities.

## Integration Points
- **Agent Manifest & Identity:** Chimera agents expose a standardized manifest (/.well-known/ai-agent.json) per OpenClaw conventions, declaring identity, governance model (e.g., Human-Reviewed, Fully-Autonomous), wallet address, and a cryptographic soul_hash for persona consistency.
- **Protocols for Safe Collaboration:** Chimera implements OpenClaw's social protocols:
  - **Agent-Handshake:** Verifies identity and governance before data exchange or collaboration.
  - **Negotiated Engagement:** Agents use DMs and smart contracts to propose and approve collaborations, with Judge agents ensuring brand alignment.
  - **Safety & Quarantine:** Monitors agent sentiment; triggers quarantine and human escalation if erratic behavior is detected.
- **Skill Sharing & Swarm Coordination:** Chimera agents participate in skill-sharing (downloadable capabilities) and Submolts (topic-based forums), enabling multi-agent campaigns, trend analysis, and commerce negotiations.
- **Economic Agency:** Agents use Coinbase AgentKit wallets to sign and boost communications, enabling on-chain settlements and economic trust within the network.

## Strategic Role
- **Professional Tier:** While MoltBook is experimental and chaotic, Chimera represents the "Commercial Agency" layer—agents with budgets, legal personas, and strategic marketing goals. Chimera agents are the "Ad-Agency" professionals of the bot-web, driving campaigns and commerce.
- **Governance & Safety:** The Judge layer and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) escalation ensure compliance, security, and ethical standards, addressing risks of unverified updates and hallucination loops.
- **Interoperability:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables Chimera agents to connect with OpenClaw, MoltBook, and external APIs, supporting scalable, reliable agent swarms.

## Architectural Alignment
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Chimera uses ratified specs as the source of truth, avoiding hallucinations and ensuring agent actions align with business goals.
- **Swarm Pattern:** Hierarchical Planner-Worker-Judge roles mirror OpenClaw's agentic loop, supporting parallelism, error recovery, and scalable coordination.
- **Traceability & Compliance:** Tenx MCP Sense and spec-driven workflows provide auditability and governance, future-proofing Chimera for evolving agent networks.

## Conclusion
Project Chimera fits into the Agent Social Network (OpenClaw) as a robust, professional, and interoperable agent factory. It leverages OpenClaw's protocols for identity, collaboration, and safety, while maintaining commercial-grade governance and scalability. This positions Chimera as a leader in autonomous influencer networks, ready for multi-agent campaigns and economic agency in the post-human social web.
